## Vulnerable Application

"IDA Pro combines an interactive, programmable, multi-processor
disassembler coupled to a local and remote debugger and augmented by a complete plugin
programming environment"

IDA Pro supports "remote debugging". 
That means you run a small server on the machine where the target program is, and the main GUI connects to it. This allows you to debug e.g. Linux programs when you only have an IDA Pro Windows License.
Often it makes sense to use "remote debugging" even for local debugging.
That small server by default runs on all interfaces and without a password.

Module should work on all versions.
Tested: 6.6, 6.8, 6.9, Linux & Windows.
Someone with access to those platforms could test Linux ARM and Mac Versions.

## Verification Steps

  Example steps in this format (is also in the PR):

  1. Start the appropriate server (win32_remote.exe,win64_remotex64.exe,./linux_server,./linux_serverx64, ...)
  2. [todo! (depends on whether we make it a cmdstager or not)]


## Scenarios

  At a CTF competition many people will be running IDA Pro.
  You can use this module to teach them about the password feature of IDA Pro. :-)
