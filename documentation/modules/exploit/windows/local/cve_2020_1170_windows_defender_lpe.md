## Vulnerable Application

An arbitrary folder deletion vulnerability exists in Windows Defender's MpCmdRun.exe binary up to and including the
latest version as of August 2020. The vulnerability occurs due to the fact Windows Defender does not apply impersonation when
it rotates its log files. Rotation of log files occurs when the size of C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log is greater than or equal
to 16MB. When this occurs, the C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log is renamed via a file move operation to
C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log.bak. By creating a junction directory named C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log.bak, and then filling
the contents of C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log so that it is greater than 16 MB in size, attackers can delete an arbitrary folder
and its contents as the SYSTEM user.

To turn this into a LPE vulnerabilty, attackers can utilize a flaw within the Windows Error Reporting service, as described by @jonaslyk
of secret.club, whereby if the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER directory does not exist (which is not normally the case), and a WER
error report is submitted, then the program C:\Windows\System32\wermgr.exe will run as SYSTEM and will create the
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER directory with permissions that allow all local users to access it.

Attackers can redirect this directory creation operation using directory junctions to create the directory
C:\Windows\System32\wermgr.exe.local with the same open permissions. Once this is done, attackers can plant
a malicious DLL named Comctl32.dll in a version specific directory underneath C:\Windows\System32\wermgr.exe.local.
Now all the attacker has to do is submit a WER error report, which will cause wermgr.exe to load and run the contents of
the malicious Comctl32.dll as the SYSTEM user.

This module has been tested with Windows 10 v1909 x64 running MpCmdRun.exe version 4.18.1902.5 and is confirmed to work
with this version, however it has been updated to also include the patch bypasses from klinix5 (aka Abdelhamid Naceri),
and as this bypass has not been patched as of August 2020, its possible this module may work on later versions as well.

Note that this code uses the NtApiDotNet.dll library, version 1.1.28, which is taken directly from
https://github.com/googleprojectzero/sandbox-attacksurface-analysis-tools/releases/tag/v1.1.28 as despite our best attempts,
it was not possible to get the file oplock code from this DLL ported into the framework via either PowerShell
or Railgun (both which had their own issues when it came to file oplocks). RDLLs were an option but considering we are
already dropping files on the host, it was decided that it was best to just drop the NtApiDotNet DLL, load this via
PowerShell, run the required operations, and then clean up this DLL and the other artifacts once we are done.

### Installation And Setup
Whilst the `check` method will work against any system with Windows Defender installed, the LPE technique that this
module uses presently only has support for Windows 10 x64 v1909, due to fact that the LPE technique relies on the
attacker dropping a malicious DLL into a specific path, and the fact that this path can change between both different
versions of the OS as well as different patch versions.

For this reason it recommended to use a clean installation of Windows 10 v1909, with Windows Defender installed. 
Ensure that no other AV is active on the target system, or Windows Defender will be disabled. The exploit has a 
check for this though, just in case. Testers will also need to be careful as once Windows Defender is updated, 
there is no way to downgrade it again. Affected MpCmdRun.exe versions are versions 4.18.2005.1 or earlier, though
this was only the latest version available as of September 1st 2020; it is possible that later versions may also
be affected if Microsoft does not patch the patch bypass used within this module and chooses to update other parts
of MpCmdRun.exe.

## Verification Steps

1. Get a non-SYSTEM meterpreter session on any target running Windows Defender with no other AV active,
   and which has a MpCmdRun.exe file version of 4.18.2004.6 or earlier.
2. `use exploit/windows/local/cve_2020_1170_windows_defender_lpe.rb`
3. `set session <session>`
4. `set LHOST <ip address of the interface to listen on>`
5. `set LPORT <port to listen on>`
6. `set PowerShellWaitTime <time to wait for PowerShell script to run on target>`
7. `exploit`
8. Verify that you get a new shell running as SYSTEM

## Options
  ### WerWaitTime
  Time to wait for the file writes to complete before clearing the WER directory. On slower
  systems or those with lots of file activity, it is recommended to increase this number.

  ### WritableDir
  A directory that the current user can write to which will be used to store the contents of
  all the files and directories moved out of C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER so it can be
  deleted or turned into a directory junction when needed.

  ### PowerShellWaitTime
  The maximum amount of time to wait for the PowerShell script to run and perform
  the following operations before Metasploit will throw a time out error:

   1. Fill up the contents of C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log and make
      its contents 16MB or larger so that the bug will be triggered
   2. Create the oplock and listen on it
   3. Perform the necessary file direct operations once the oplock has been triggered.
   4. Release the oplock once these operations have been done.

  As these operations can take some time to run, this setting is set to a default of 90 minutes.
  If the target system is running a slower processor or hard disk, it is recommended to increase
  this value to prevent time out issues.

## Scenarios

### Windows 10 v1909 x64 with MpCmdRun.exe version 4.18.1902.5
