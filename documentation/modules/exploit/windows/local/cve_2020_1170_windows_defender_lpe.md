## Vulnerable Application

An arbitrary folder deletion vulnerability exists in Windows Defender's MpCmdRun.exe binary up to and including the
latest version as of August 2020. The vulnerability occurs due to the fact Windows Defender does not apply impersonation when
it rotates its log files. Rotation of log files occurs when the size of C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log is greater than or equal
to 16MB. When this occurs, the C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log is renamed via a file move operation to 
C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log.bak. By creating a junction directory named C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log.bak, and then filling 
the contents of C:\Windows\Temp\MpCmdRun.log so that it is greater than 16 MB in size, attackers can delete an arbitrary folder
and its contents as the SYSTEM user.

To turn this into a LPE vulnerabilty, attackers can utilize a flaw within the Windows Error Reporting service, as described by @jonaslyk
of secret.club, whereby if the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER directory does not exist (which is not normally the case), and a WER
error report is submitted, then the program C:\Windows\System32\wermgr.exe will run as SYSTEM and will create the
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER directory with permissions that allow all local users to access it.

Attackers can redirect this directory creation operation using directory junctions to create the directory
C:\Windows\System32\wermgr.exe.local with the same open permissions. Once this is done, attackers can plant
a malicious DLL named Comctl32.dll in a version specific directory underneath C:\Windows\System32\wermgr.exe.local.
Now all the attacker has to do is submit a WER error report, which will cause wermgr.exe to load and run the contents of
the malicious Comctl32.dll as the SYSTEM user.

This module has been tested with Windows 10 v1909 x64 running MpCmdRun.exe version 4.18.1902.5 and is confirmed to work
with this version, however it has been updated to also include the patch bypasses from klinix5 (aka Abdelhamid Naceri),
and as this bypass has not been patched as of August 2020, its possible this module may work on later versions as well.

Note that this code uses the NtApiDotNet.dll library, version 1.1.28, which is taken directly from
https://github.com/googleprojectzero/sandbox-attacksurface-analysis-tools/releases/tag/v1.1.28 as despite our best attempts,
it was not possible to get the file oplock code from this DLL ported into the framework via either PowerShell
or Railgun (both which had their own issues when it came to file oplocks). RDLLs were an option but considering we are
already dropping files on the host, it was decided that it was best to just drop the NtApiDotNet DLL, load this via
PowerShell, run the required operations, and then clean up this DLL and the other artifacts once we are done.

### Installation And Setup
All affected systems should have the Windows Defender installed. You will however need to make sure that no other
AV is active on the target system, or Windows Defender will be disabled. The exploit has a check for this in case
you forget though so you can check if Windows Defender is disabled or not. Testers will also need to be careful as
once Windows Defender is updated, there is no way to downgrade it again.

For these reasons testers are recommended to use a clean installation of Windows 10 v1903 or Windows 10 v1909, which should have
everything needed to test out this issue, and ensure that the target does not receive any updates. Just be sure that
the installed version of MpCmdRun.exe is a version prior to 4.18.2005.1.

## Verification Steps

1. Get a non-SYSTEM meterpreter session on any target running Windows Defender with no other AV active,
   and which has a MpCmdRun.exe file version of 4.18.2004.6 or earlier.
2. `use exploit/windows/local/cve_2020_1170_windows_defender_lpe.rb`
3. `set session <session>`
4. `set RHOST <target ip>`
5. `set LPORT <port to open on target>`
4. `exploit`
5. Verify that you get a new shell running as SYSTEM

## Options
  ### WaitTime
  Time to wait for file writes to complete before clearing the WER directory. On slower
  systems or those with lots of file activity, it is recommended to increase this number.

  ### WritableDir
  A directory that the current user can write to which will be used to store the contents of
  all the files and directories moved out of C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER so it can be
  deleted or turned into a directory junction when needed.
