## Description

This module generates a macro-enabled Microsoft Office Word document. It does not target a specific
CVE or vulnerability, this is more of a feature-abuse in Office, however this type of
social-engineering attack still remains common today.

There are many ways to create this type of malicious doc. The module injects the Base64-encoded
payload in the comments field, which will get decoded back by the macro and executed as a Windows
executable when the Office document is launched.


## Vulnerable Application

A Windows machine with Microsoft Office installed. The Office application must support the docm
format.

Specifically, this module was tested specifically against:

* Microsoft Office 2010.
* Microsoft Office 2013.
* Microsoft Office 2016.

## Verification Steps

1. ```use exploit/windows/fileformat/office_word_macro```
2. ```set PAYLOAD [PAYLOAD NAME]```
3. Configure the rest of the settings accordingly (BODY, LHOST, LPORT, etc)
4. ```exploit```
5. The module should generate the malicious docm.

## Options

**BODY** Text to put in the Office document. See **Modification** below if you wish to modify more.

## Demo

In this example, first we generate the malicious docm exploit, and then we set up a
windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp handler to receive a session. Next, we copy the docm
exploit to a Windows machine with Office 2013 installed, when the document runs the
macro, we get a session:

## Modification

To use this exploit in a real environment, you will most likely need to modify the docm content.
Here's one approach you can do:

1. Use the module to generate the malicious docm
2. Copy the malicious docm to a Windows machine, and edit it with Microsoft Office (such as 2013).
   When you open the document, the payload will probably do something on your machine. It's ok,
   since you generated it, it should not cause any problems for you.
3. Save the doc, and test again to make sure the payload still works.

While editing, you should avoid modifying the following unless you are an advanced user:

* The comments field. If you have to modify this, make sure to create 55 empty spaces
  in front of the payload string. The blank space is for making the payload less obvious
  at first sight if the user views the file properties.
* The VB code in the macro.

## Trusted Document

By default, Microsoft Office does not execute macros automatically unless it is considered as a
trusted document. This means that if a macro is present, the user will most likely need to manually
click on the "Enable Content" button in order to run the macro.

Many in-the-wild attacks face this type of challenge, and most rely on social-engineering to trick
the user into allowing the macro to run. For example, making the document look like something
written from a legit source, such as [this attack](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/these-hackers-cleverly-disguised-their-malware-as-a-document-about-trumps-victory).

To truly make the macro document to run without any warnings, you must somehow figure out a way to
sign the macro by a trusted publisher, or using a certificate that the targeted machine trusts.

For testing purposes, another way to have a certificate is to create a self-signed one using
Microsoft Office's SELFCERT.exe utility. This tool can be found in the following path on
Windows:

```
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\SELFCERT.exe
```

In Office 2010, the self-signing tool is actually an option in the Office tools folder in the
start menu. It should be named "Digital Certificate for VBA Projects".

Double-click on the executable, enter a random name and click "OK", at this point you have a
certificate to play with.

Next, we want to flag this certificate as trusted:

1. Click on Start, and then enter "Internet Options".
2. Click on the Content tab, and then click on the Certificates button.
3. You should see your new certificate under the Personal tab, export it.
4. Click on the Trusted Publishers, and then import your personal certificate.
5. Try the macro exploit again, it should run the malicious code without warning.
