## Intro

This module is designed to be a platform to test an endpoints application whitelisting effectiveness by providing bypasses to  solutions such as software restriction policies and applocker.
The main vector for these bypasses is to abuse trusted binaries (i.e Microsoft signed) that can execute user supplied code.

## Vulnerable Application

These bypasses will work on all versions of windows that include .net versions 3.5 or greater (note: ensure the selected payload matches the target os architecture).

## Usage

1. Start msfconsole
2. Do: ```use exploit/windows/misc/whitelist_bypass_server```
3. Do: ```set PAYLOAD [PAYLOAD NAME]```
4. Do: ```exploit```
5. from the endpoint to be tested navigate to the URLPATH and you should receive a webpage like the following:
