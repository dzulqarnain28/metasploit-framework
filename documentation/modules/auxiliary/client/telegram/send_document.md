This module allows you to send a document(binary, video, audio etc.) to a given `chat_id` on telegram using a telegram bot.
This module can also be used to send a specified document to multiple users with an optional message and can be used for phishing.

## Module Options

**Bot Token**

Each Telegram bot is given a unique authentication token when it is created. The token looks like
`123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`. You can generate a new token by messaging @botfather via `https://t.me/botfather` and
sending the message `/newbot` to it, which should prompt it to ask a series of questions that will allow you to generate your bot.
Once you have completed this, you should get a message saying `Use this token to access the HTTP API:` followed by the value of the
bot's token. Use this value for `BOT_TOKEN`. If you have any issues, refer to [this document](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

**CHAT ID**

Unique identifier for a chat. To get the `CHAT_ID` value, send a message to the bot username that you created
earlier. Then browse to `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN VALUE>/getUpdates`
and look for a line like `"chat":"id":1344308063`. That ID is what you will
want to use the value of `CHAT_ID`; in this case it would be `1344308063`.

**MESSAGE**

The message that you want to send with the document, it can be something promising so the user opens the document.

**DOCUMENT**
The path of the document to be sent.

**IDFILE**
The path of the file which contains different CHAT_IDs, on per line.
