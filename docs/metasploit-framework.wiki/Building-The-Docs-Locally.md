# Building the Docs Locally
Whilst you can always browse the documentation at https://docs.metasploit.com/, sometimes there are cases where you 
may not be able to reach this site, such as when you are on a client engagement with limited or no access to the public internet.

In these cases, you may want to refer to `docs/README.md` in your Metasploit installation to find instructions on
how to build the documentation and host it on a local server. Note that this will build the documentation website that
you can find at https://docs.metasploit.com/ locally using the files located under the `docs/` folder of your Metasploit 
installation.
