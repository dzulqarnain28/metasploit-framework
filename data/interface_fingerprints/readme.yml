# This is a default yml fingerprint file. It mostly servers to host parameter
#   information and other required notes about the scanner.

####### Thoughts ####
#
# - A fingerprint with no success string is preferred over no fingerprint at all.
#       However if a success string is added please be very confident as otherwise
#       false results are fed into the database.
# - Unfortunately two ports cannot be done at once at this time (e.g. 80 and 443)
# - A page that redirects from 80 to 443 will break the checks.
 

#### Comments on parameters ####
# Those with !! are required.
#
#!!   title: The title of the check. 
#!!   fingerprint_page: The URI to check when detecting what the interface is.
#!!   fingerprint: regex of initial response used to fingerprint the page. This is
#           a required page or it won't detect any pages.
#     post_to: page to send login creds to if different from fingerprint_page. 
#     login_params: string containing login params
#           !!NOTE!! use $$$user$$$and $$$pass$$$  for the username and pass. These
#           will be replaced with the real creds and automatically URL encoded.
#	    $$$domain$$$ will also add in the domain from the datastore 
#     success: Check the login response for this string to signify a successful attempt (regex)
#     references: places to read more about what can be done from here 
#     method: HTTP Method to use when sending login_params, defaults to POST
#     creds: default credentials to check for. Using null for user or pass will
#           be replaced with a blank string. Set to nocreds:nocreds if the interface
#           does not require credentials to login. To use multiple creds, use an array.
#     basic_auth: if the page uses basic_auth,this must be set for basic to be attempted.
#     hidden_id: An array of hidden params that are read from the fingerprint page
#           and submitted with the request. Common examples are __VIEWSTATE or a CSRF token
#           which can be read from the page and submitted with the request. The source page
#           will need to have labeled these as <input type="hidden" for them to get picked up.
#     cookie: Add anything you want from the cookie, this only applies to login attempts.
#		using $$$vhost$$$ will replace the vhost in the cookie itself. 
#     fp_headers: Add additional header strings to the fingerprint; must be YAML hash
#     login_headers: Add additional header strings to the login attempt; must be YAML hash
#     res_code: A success code other than 200.
#     follow_302: After a login attempt if a 302 or 301 should be followed to check for success.
#           This is common but not always necessary for a good fingerprint.
