= Metasploit

The Metasploit Framework is released under a BSD-style license. See
COPYING for more details.

== Installing

Generally, you should use the installer which contains all dependencies
and will get you up and running with a few clicks. See the [Dev
Environment Setup][github-wiki] if you'd like to deal with dependencies
on your own.

== Using Metasploit

Metasploit can do all sorts of things. The first thing you'll want to do
is start `msfconsole`, but after that, you'll probably be best served by
reading some of the great tutorials online:

  * The official Metasploit wiki on Github
  * Metasploit Unleashed
  * baz
