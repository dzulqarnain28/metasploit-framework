Metasploit
==
The Metasploit Framework is released under a BSD-style license. See
COPYING for more details.

Installing
--
Generally, you should use the installer which contains all dependencies
and will get you up and running with a few clicks. See the [Dev
Environment Setup][wiki-devenv] if you'd like to deal with dependencies
on your own.

Using Metasploit
--
Metasploit can do all sorts of things. The first thing you'll want to do
is start `msfconsole`, but after that, you'll probably be best served by
reading some of the great tutorials online:

  * [Metasploit Unleashed][unleashed]
  * [The official Metasploit wiki on Github][wiki-start]
